## About the slide

This slide is put together for the project 4 of Developing Data products course. The main objective of this course is to be able to develop data science products that can be hosted on the web for others to see.


Following slides will display the Shiny app created for this project alongwith other information about the project


## Project details

- Summary:

The app created using Shiny app predicts Horsepower of a car from given value of Miles per Gallon.

The dataset used for this project is mtcars, which is readily available in R library

- Approach
1. We will build two models that will predict the Horsepower of the car.
2. First model will take MPG value of greater than 20.
3. Other model will take all the values for MPG available in the dataset.
4. We will fit a linear model on both the above MPG values and predict value of Horsepower
5. Model will be trained on the values available in the mtcars dataset
6. User will be alowed to choose a particular MPG value from the slider available and also if they wish to see any one model output from the above

## Summary of the dataset mtcars

```{r , echo = TRUE}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Plot between Horsepower and MPG

```{r}
plot(mtcars$hp~mtcars$mpg)
```


## Below is the model output with MPG as 10
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('C:\\Users\\csoni\\OneDrive - VMware, Inc\\Coursera\\Data Science John Hopkins\\Coure 9\\Week4\\image1.png')

```


## Below is the model output with MPG as 20
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('C:\\Users\\csoni\\OneDrive - VMware, Inc\\Coursera\\Data Science John Hopkins\\Coure 9\\Week4\\image2.png')

```
